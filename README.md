# Fannie Mae Loan Performance Prediction
 
The aim of this project is use data collected on a large number of loans in Oct of 2021, to develop
prediction models for the number of months payments are made on mortgage loans and for predicting foreclosure of a loan based on information available to FNMA at the time the loan is put
on their books.

Some background:


FNMA aka Fannie Mae (look it up in Wikipedia) was put in place in order to ensure liquidity in
the US mortgage loan markets. When a mortgage holder secures a mortgage from a bank, the
bank will sell that mortgage to FNMA giving them the capital to enable them to make additional
future loans. The FNMA bundles the mortgages they acqure into what are called mortgage-backed
securities (MBSâ€™s) and sells them to investors while insuring the underlying mortgages against losses
of principal. The investors recieve the bundle of monthy payments associated with the underlying
mortgages. When a holder of a mortgages forcloseses/defaults, or sells their house, or refinances
their mortgage while most of the principle is transferred to the holder of the MBS, but this means
that their future cash flow might not be as expected (interest rates may have gone down so any
future bond investments bring lower returns). So the investor, in pricing the value of their asset,
would like to be able to predict outcomes such as foreclosure or when the loan will be settled.
